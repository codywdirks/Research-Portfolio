rbg3_synthetic_control.do
- Description: Stata .do file analyzing the impact of the "Read by Three" policy in Nevada. This policy mandates a reading curriculum aimed at improving reading scores within the state.
- Project Context: Part of a coauthored research paper investigating the effectiveness of the policy.
- Results: We were able to find that there was a small, but statistically significant positive impact on reading scores pre-COVID. This was tested against 8th grade reading scores as well as math scores for the treated cohort.

Description: Python .py file containing preliminary results from a causal forest analysis.
Project Context: Part of a coauthored research paper investigating the sources of labor market discrimination from other published experimental papers.
Current Status: Results are currently inconclusive, which may be due to a data issue that is actively being investigated
