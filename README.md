## About Me
My name is Cody Dirks, and my current work centers on exploring the intersection of data analytics and economics to find causality and further our understanding of economics. My current work focuses on experimental economics, the economics of discrimination, and policy analysis. I currently hold a Master's of Science in Business Analytics and a Bachelor's of Science in Economics/History from Southern Utah University.
